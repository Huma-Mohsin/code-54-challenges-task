//solution:

// asking for a task to be performed in a sandbox environment or on a local hard drive to ensure functionality. Here's how student might approach it:

1-Set Up a Sandbox Environment: If you're testing code, you can use an online code editor or IDE like CodePen, JSFiddle, or Replit. These platforms provide sandboxed environments where you can write and run code without affecting your local system.

Write and Test the Code: Once you've chosen your sandbox environment, write your code and test it to ensure it works as expected. Make any necessary adjustments until you achieve the desired functionality.

Save and Share the Results: Once you're satisfied with the code and its functionality, you can save it within the sandbox environment. If you need to share the code or results with others, most sandbox platforms provide options to generate a shareable link or embed the code in a webpage.

2-Alternatively, Use a Local Environment: If you prefer to work on your local hard drive, you can set up a development environment using tools like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other code editor. Write and test your code locally, and ensure it functions correctly before proceeding.
